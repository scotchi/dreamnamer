## Usage

Simply drop movie or TV series files on Dreamnamer, and it will attempt to clean up their file names based on matches from The Movie Database.

At present there's no configurability for the filename format, though that will be added at some point down the line.

Dreamnamer takes a little while at startup while it grabs a dump of The Movie Database and indexes it.  This will be done on startup if the index is more than a week old.
